## <a name="Intro">Intro</a>
The app is split into a Client (AngularJS) and Server (Python) structure.  Each can be developed independently of each other.  See below for instructions on how to set up your dev environment.

[See our FAQ if you hit any problems getting setup](https://github.com/hotosm/tasking-manager/wiki/Dev-Environment-FAQ)

**Looking to get involved in development?** Check out the [Working Group meeting details](https://github.com/hotosm/tasking-manager/wiki/TM-Working-Group-Meeting-Details), review the [Roadmap](https://github.com/hotosm/tasking-manager/projects/1), and review our Contributor guidelines](https://github.com/hotosm/tasking-manager/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Global Dependencies
Following must be available locally:

* NodeJS LTS v6+ [NodeJS LTS install here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is used to run and build the app, install globally as follows:
    * ```npm install gulp -g```

### App Dependencies
You will now have to install all the app dependencies using [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```
cd client
npm install
```

### Running Locally
If you plan to do client development you can run the app using gulp, without having to worry too much about the server. If you want to point the client at a non-local API (e.g. a staging environment), you'll have to change the environment config for development in `client/taskingmanager.config.json.

```
cd client   [if not already in client]
gulp run
```

### Running Unit Tests
The client has a suite of [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) Unit Tests, that you can run using [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/index.html) as follows

```
 cd client    [if not already in client]
 karma start ..\tests\client\karma.conf.js
```

## <a name="ServerDevelopment">Server Development</a>
### Dependencies
Following must be available locally:

* Python 3.6 - [Python 3.6 install here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Build the Server
* Create a Python Virtual Environment, using Python 3.6:
    * ```python -m venv ./venv```
* Activate your virtual environment and install dependencies:
    * Linux/Mac:
        * ```. ./venv/bin/activate```
        * ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
    * Windows (use installer because of precompiled libs):
        * ```.\venv\scripts\activate```
        * ```.\devops\win\install.bat```

### Environment vars:
As the project is open source, we have to keep secrets out of the repo.  You will need to setup the following env vars locally:

* **TM_DB** - This is for the PostGIS connection string.  If you can't access an existing DB refer to DevOps page to [set up a local DB in Docker](https://github.com/hotosm/tasking-manager/wiki/Dev-Ops#creating-a-local-postgis-database-with-docker)
* **TM_SECRET** - This is secret key for the TM app used by itsdangerous and flask-oauthlib for entropy
* **TM_CONSUMER_KEY** - This is the OAUTH Consumer Key used for authenticating the Tasking Manager App in OSM
* **TM_CONSUMER_SECRET** - This is the OAUTH Consumer Secret used for authenticating the Tasking Manager App in OSM
* **TM_SMTP_HOST** - The hostname for the SMTP server that is used to send email alerts
* **TM_SMTP_PORT** - The port number for the SMTP server that is used to send email alerts
* **TM_SMTP_USER** - The user for the SMTP server that is used to send email alerts
* **TM_SMTP_PASSWORD** - The password for the SMTP server that is used to send email alerts

* Linux/Mac:
    * (It is strongly recommended to set these within your .bash_profile so they are available to all processes)
    * ```export TM_DB=postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST/DATABASE```
    * ```export TM_SECRET=secret-key-here```
    * ```export TM_CONSUMER_KEY=oauth-consumer-key-goes-here```
    * ```export TM_CONSUMER_SECRET=oauth-consumer-secret-key-goes-here```
    * ```export TM_SMTP_HOST=smtp-server-host-here```
    * ```export TM_SMTP_PORT=smtp-server-port-here```
    * ```export TM_SMTP_USER=smtp-server-user-here```
    * ```export TM_SMTP_PASSWORD=smtp-server-password-here```
* Windows:
    * ```setx TM_DB "postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST/DATABASE"```
    * ```setx TM_SECRET "secret-key-here"```
    * ```setx TM_CONSUMER_KEY "oauth-consumer-key-goes-here"```
    * ```setx TM_CONSUMER_SECRET "oauth-consumer-secret-key-goes-here"```
    * ```setx TM_SMTP_HOST "smtp-server-host-here"```
    * ```setx TM_SMTP_PORT "smtp-server-port-here"```
    * ```setx TM_SMTP_USER "smtp-server-user-here"```
    * ```setx TM_SMTP_PASSWORD "smtp-server-password-here"```

### Creating the DB
We use [Flask-Migrate](https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to create the database from the migrations directory.  If you can't access an existing DB refer to DevOps page to [set up a local DB in Docker](https://github.com/hotosm/tasking-manager/wiki/Dev-Ops#creating-a-local-postgis-database-with-docker) create the database as follows:

```
python manage.py db upgrade
```

### Running Locally

#### API Development only
If you plan to only work on the API you don't need to build the client and can run as follows:

* Run the server:
    * ``` python manage.py runserver -d -r```
* Point your browser to:
    * [http://localhost:5000/api-docs](http://localhost:5000/api-docs)

#### Seeing the client
If you want to see the client you will need to follow all the instruction in **Client Development** section then build the client as follows:

* Build the client using gulp:
    * ```cd client```
    * ```gulp build```
* You can now run the server as above from the root dir:
    * ```cd ..```
    * ``` python manage.py runserver -d -r```
* Point your browser to:
    * [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

### Running Unit Tests
The project includes a suite of Unit and Integration tests that you should run after any changes

```
python -m unittest discover tests/server
```

### Server Config

#### Environment Vars

On boot the Tasking Manager App will look for the following environment vars:

* **TM_ENV** - Allows you to specify which config to load from `./server/config.py`.  
    * Acceptable values:
      * **Dev** - This is the default
      * **Staging** - Use this for your staging/test environment
      * **Prod** - Use this for your production environment
