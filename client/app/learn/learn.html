                            <p>It is very easy to get started mapping in OpenStreetMap and contribute to HOT projects. People 
                               around the world rely on OpenStreetMap data contributed by millions of people over the past 
                               10 years. While it is easy to get started, it does take some effort and practice to do well. 
                               If this is your first time mapping, please take about 30 mins to watch the video 
                               (in English with multi-language subtitles) to learn the basics of how to map using the OSM 
                               web browser based editor called iD. Please, now and in the future, always focus on quality, 
                               not quantity of mapping you do.</p>

                            <p>Validation is a second set of eyes reviewing initial mapping. This is usually done by experienced 
                               OSM mappers and consists of reviewing the mapping for completeness (something anyone can do) and using 
                               various tools to make sure the mapping does not have any technical mistakes, buildings sharing a wall 
                               with a road for example. This video (in English with mult-language subtitles) will take you through the 
                               basics of validating mapping for HOT projects.</p>
