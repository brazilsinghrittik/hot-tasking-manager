                    <p>During diaster preparation, response and recovery, detailed geospatial information, maps of roads, 
						buildings, bridges, etc is critical to dealivering the best service and support in the most timely
                        and efficient way possible. Unfortunately this kind of information is not open and freely accessable
                        for large parts of the world. Through coordinated, remote satellite or UAV imagery based mapping and a close working
                        partnership with people on the ground you can help provide that data where and when needed.</p>

                                under 5 and women. Malaria is prevalent in some of the most unmapped places. Malaria is a 
                                preventable and curable disease, but currently organisations do not have detailed data on the 
                                number of vulnerable people in an area, which reduces their ability to respond."

                                us, but the country remains an endemic area for cholera. Some places in the north and in the 
                                west are regularly faced with killing waves. Therefore, it is highly necessary to proceed to a 
                                substantive treatment of the epidemic."
