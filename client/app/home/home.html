As recently as 2008 a cyclone killed at least 77,000 people with over 55,900 missing, and left about 2.5 million homeless."

NGOs on the ground need better road and residential area data to facilitate their outreach work. Community mappers from a HOT microgrant, together with YouthMappers from the Institute of Rural Development Planning will map employment opportunities as part of a project to reduce youth vulnerability starting on 26th August. This base map will assist with this field mapping."
