# Customize your Tasking Manager

This guide intends to walk you through the process of customizing the Tasking Manager for your own use.

## CSS

The frontend site CSS is built from the files at https://github.com/hotosm/tasking-manager/tree/develop/client/assets/styles/sass.

## Images

Logos are stored at https://github.com/hotosm/tasking-manager/tree/develop/client/assets/img for the site frontend and at https://github.com/hotosm/tasking-manager/tree/develop/server/web/static/swagger-ui/images for the API site.

## Configuration (site URL, hashtags, contact)

Most of the site configuration, such as the URL of the site, default changeset hashtags, and contact email addresses, are found in https://github.com/hotosm/tasking-manager/blob/develop/server/config.py.
