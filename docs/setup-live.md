## Live setup

### Docker Hub

The most recommended source for live deployments are our Docker images built for every release on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/hotosm/tasking-manager). The containers tagged with `latest` is always pointing to our latest release.


### Source Code

Alternatively you can install your own environment. Please use our [official and latest release](https://github.com/hotosm/tasking-manager/releases) for this.
