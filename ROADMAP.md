# Roadmap

Tasking Manager development is overseen by the Tasking Manager Working Group. The working group consists of code contributors and project stakeholders and meets on a bi-weekly basis. 

See [Working Group wiki page](https://github.com/hotosm/tasking-manager/wiki/TM-Working-Group-Meeting-Details) for meeting details.

## Roadmap Work Areas

The roadmap consists of seven work areas: 
  - Onboarding
  - Task Prioritization
  - Machine Learning guidance integration
  - Team/project management
  - Performance/scalability/usability improvements
  - Validation improvements
  - Metrics: Mapping and user stats

### Active
* Resolve performance and scalability issues
* Conduct user testing and a design review
* Resolve feature parity between TMv2 and TMv3

### Work currently being planned
* Add groups/organizations for improved project and team management
* Add new analytics for users, projects, groups
* Add AI/ML integration for improved mapping efficiency
* Improved validation methods
* Data quality feedback, integrations

## Longer term ideas/directions
- Refactor frontend to React
- Address the overlap of TM and MapCampaigner functionalities, should they be separate tools
- Improve the connection between remote and field (not just API but workflow and engagement)
- Support moving from creating data in unmapped areas to updating areas with new imagery or information
